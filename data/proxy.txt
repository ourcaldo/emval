# SOCKS5 Proxy List Configuration
# 
# This file contains a list of SOCKS5 proxies used for SMTP validation.
# Proxies are automatically rotated in round-robin fashion with rate limiting (1 request/proxy/second).
#
# Supported Formats (one proxy per line):
# 1. host:port                    - Proxy without authentication
# 2. host:port@username:password  - Proxy with authentication
#
# Examples:
# 192.168.1.100:1080
# proxy.example.com:1080
# 149.81.34.182:1080@myuser:mypass123
# socks5-server.net:9050@username:password
#
# Notes:
# - Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
# - Invalid proxy formats will be logged as warnings
# - Must be SOCKS5 proxies (HTTP proxies won't work for SMTP connections)
# - Enable proxy in config/settings.yaml by setting smtp.use_proxy to true
# - Rate limiting: 1 request per proxy per second (configurable in config)
#
# Add your SOCKS5 proxies below (one per line):
